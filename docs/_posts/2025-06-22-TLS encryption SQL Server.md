tags: [MSSQL, SQLServer, Certificate, TLS, Encryption]
summary: "It takes minimal effort to install a TLS certificate to encrypt the traffic between your client and the SQL Server. Every new operational database product provided by Microsoft now has encryption in flight by default. Why would you not do it for your current SQL installations? Do not expose your data especially when the amount of effort is minimal."
